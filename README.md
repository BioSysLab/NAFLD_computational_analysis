This repository contains the image analysis algorithm for the quantification of the lipid accumulation, regarding the current study.

The algorithm was created in MATLAB (v.2018a) by Prof. George K. Matsopoulos and Konstantinos Zeakis from BIOMIG lab ( https://biomig.ntua.gr/ ), at the School of Electrical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece.

Full usage and distribution rights were given to the BioSysLab.
